# Pocket-Golf
Pocket Golf is my first project. It predates my use of GitHub, and instead used PlasticSCM. It is free with no advertisements, and therefore I am hosting it here for download!

These are the source files for the project. Since Pocket Golf is free to play, and there is no monitisation strategy, I figured there is no harm in pushing the project to GitHub.

Download, import into Unity (newest version recommended), and play around.
